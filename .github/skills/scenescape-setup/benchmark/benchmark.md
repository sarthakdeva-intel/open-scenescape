# Skill Benchmark: dlstreamer-coding-agent

**Agents**: Copilot (`claude-haiku-4.5`)  
**Grader**: Copilot (`gpt-5.3-codex`)  
**Date**: 2026-08-07T08:55:40Z  
**Evals**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (1 run per configuration)

## Summary

> Skill lift = with skill − without skill. ↑ = better, ↓ = higher cost (expected).

### Evals passed

| Agent | w/o skill | w/ skill | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| Copilot (`claude-haiku-4.5`) | 0 / 7 | 2 / 7 | **+2 ↑** |

### Pass rate (avg ± σ across evals)

| Agent | w/o skill | w/ skill | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| Copilot (`claude-haiku-4.5`) | 45% ±20% | 75% ±34% | **+30pp ↑** |

### Time (total across all evals)

| Agent | w/o skill | w/ skill | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| Copilot (`claude-haiku-4.5`) | 257 s | 808 s | +551 s ↓ |

### Tokens (total across all evals)

| Agent | w/o skill | w/ skill | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| Copilot (`claude-haiku-4.5`) | 273k | 1892k | +1619k ↓ |

## Per-Eval Detail

> Each cell is PASS/FAIL for that run, with the count of expectations met in parentheses (e.g. `PASS (5/5)`); `n/a` means no grading.json was found for that (eval, config, agent) combination.
