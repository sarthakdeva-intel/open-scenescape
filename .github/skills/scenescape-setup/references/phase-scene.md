# Running Scene Alone (steps 11–13)

Use this when the user asks to (re)run **only** reconstruction, finalization, or tracking
verification for a deployment where calibration (steps 9–10) is already complete.

## Prerequisite

Calibration must be complete for this `deploy_dir`. Uses `scene_name` and `camera_ids` from
`deploy-inputs.json`.

## Safety rules

- Reconstruction and finalization write into the scene named in `deploy-inputs.json`; do not
  substitute a different scene name without explicit user confirmation.
- Restrict file writes to `<deploy_dir>` and `$SKILL_DIR`.

## Run

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/deploy_scenescape.sh" \
  --deploy-dir <deploy_dir> \
  --skill-dir "$SKILL_DIR" \
  --phase scene
```

Reconstruction creates/finalizes the scene named in `deploy-inputs.json`.

Reconstruction and tracking verification (step 13 waits up to ~2 minutes for scene readiness) can
take a while; launch in an async terminal and poll rather than blocking if run standalone.
