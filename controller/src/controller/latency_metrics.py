class MatchLatencyTracker:
  """
  Tracks per-match latency: the elapsed time between a track's first
  appearance and its match/no-match decision. Keeps a bounded rolling window
  of recent measurements in memory so downstream metrics (dashboards,
  exporters, health checks) can be derived from real measurements rather
  than estimates.

  Every sample is also pushed as a raw value to an OTel histogram
  (record_reid_match_latency), so P95/P99 can be computed rigorously
  downstream (e.g. Prometheus histogram_quantile()) over whatever time
  range is queried -- not estimated in-process over a fixed sample count.

  Each recorded sample can be tagged with a camera_count and category
  supplied by the caller (see recordMatchLatency) -- this class has no
  camera or category knowledge of its own. UUIDManager derives camera_count
  via CameraRegistry (configured cameras that have produced embeddings for
  this scene) and passes through sscape_object.category, so no REST calls are
  needed. category
  matters because a single controller process runs one MatchLatencyTracker
  per tracked category (e.g. "person", "car") -- without tagging, two
  categories' metrics would collide on the same unlabeled OTel time series.

  Thread-safe: intended to be shared across the tracker thread and the
  ThreadPoolExecutor worker threads that resolve similarity queries.
