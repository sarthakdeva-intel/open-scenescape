# Deploy Scenescape (Prebuilt Containers)

This guide explains how to deploy Scenescape using prebuilt Docker images, primarily from Docker Hub.

## 1. Set Up Docker Environment

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. For help, refer to [Installing Docker on your system](../get-started/system-requirements.md#installing-docker-on-your-system).

## 2. Generate secrets and download OpenVINO Model Zoo models

```bash
make init-secrets install-models
```

## 3. Use Prebuilt Images for Scenescape Deployment

Prebuilt containers are published on Docker Hub:

- [Scenescape Manager](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-manager)
- [Scenescape Controller](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-controller)
- [Scenescape Analytics](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-analytics)
- [Scenescape Autocalibration](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-autocalibration)
- [Scenescape Tracker](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-tracker)
- [Scenescape Cluster Analytics](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-cluster-analytics)
- [Scenescape Mapping](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/scenescape-mapping)

## 4. Configure preloaded scenes at deployment

- **Skip preloading:** Do not set the `EXAMPLEDB` environment variable.
- **Preload database:** Set `EXAMPLEDB` to the path of your database tar file and ensure the folder is mounted. Example override:

  ```yaml
  web:
    environment:
      - EXAMPLEDB=/home/scenescape/Scenescape/sample_data/exampledb.tar.bz2
      - SUPASS=<password>
    volumes:
      - vol-sample-data:/home/scenescape/Scenescape/sample_data
  ```

## 5. Start Services

Start the demo without rebuilding local images (relies entirely on the prebuilt containers):

```bash
SUPASS=<password> DEMO_REBUILD_IMAGES=false make demo
```

> `DEMO_REBUILD_IMAGES=false` skips the re-building images locally from source.

Verify that all containers are running:

```bash
docker ps
```

## 6. Import Scenes

After the services are up, scenes can be imported either via API (`curl`) or the Web UI.

### 6.1 Using `curl`

1. Obtain an authentication token:

   ```bash
   curl --location --insecure -X POST -d "username=admin&password=<password>" https://<ip_address>/api/v1/auth
   ```

   > Note: `<password>` is the same as used in `SUPASS=<password> make demo`.

2. Upload the scene ZIP:

   ```bash
   curl -k -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Token <token>" \
     -F "zipFile=@<path_to_zip>" \
     https://<ip_address>/api/v1/import-scene/
   ```

### 6.2 Using the Web UI

1. Log in with admin credentials.
2. Navigate to **Import Scene**.
3. Select and upload the scene ZIP.
