  This is the single entry point that replaces scene._updateEvents.  The
  caller (Scene) is responsible for:
    - resolving cur_objects from the tracker or analytics cache
    - converting them to AnalyticsObject via moving_object_to_analytics_object

  Objects are filtered internally by MIN_FRAMES_FOR_RELIABLE_TRACK using
  publishedLocations length (Controller-proper maturity policy).

  Args:
    detection_type:    Detection category string (e.g. 'person').
    now:               Current epoch timestamp (float).
    cur_objects:       List of AnalyticsObject for this frame.
    regions:           Dict of {key: Region} — geometry regions.
    sensors:           Dict of {key: Sensor} — sensor regions.
    tripwires:         Dict of {key: Tripwire}.
    events:            Mutable dict; region, count, and tripwire events are
                       appended here.
    state_store:       AnalyticsStateStore that owns all analytics state for
                       this scene.
    is_intersecting_fn: Optional callable(obj, region) -> bool for 3-D mesh
